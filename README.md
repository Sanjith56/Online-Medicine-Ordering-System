The Main File which we use is the flaskapp.py and the mysql connections are present in the mssqlyconn.py file
In tha Backend we must create tables according to the ER Diagram provided.

The respective files must imported into the pycharm library and then we must initialize the server.
Once the server has been started we can access it locally on the system and run the online medicine ordering system.

This was just a small project I did with my fellow colleague and it was out first experience at a complete project with both backend and frontend with a connection.
